Beaker Changelog
=================

0.7.1 (**svn**)

0.7 (05/18/07)
* WARNING: Cleaned up Cache object based on Mako cache object, this changes
  the call interface slightly for creating a Cache object directly. The
  middleware cache object is unaffected from an end-user view. This change
  also avoids duplicate creations of Cache objects.
* Adding database backend and unit tests.
* Added memcached test, fixed memcached namespace arg passing.
* Fixed session and cache tests, still failing syncdict test. Added doctests
  for Cache and Session middleware.
* Cleanup of container/cache/container_test
* Namespaces no longer require a context, removed NamespaceContext?
* Logging in container.py uses logging module
* Cleanup of argument passing, use name **kwargs instead of **params for 
  generic kwargs
* Container classes contain a static create_namespace() method, namespaces are 
  accessed from the ContainerContext? via string name + container class alone
* Implemented (but not yet tested) clear() method on Cache, locates all 
  Namespaces used thus far and clears each one based on its keys() collection
* Fixed Cache.clear() method to actually clear the Cache namespace.
* Updated memcached backend to split servers on ';' for multiple memcached
  backends.
* Merging MyghtyUtils code into Beaker.

0.6.3 (03/18/2007)
* Added api with customized Session that doesn't require a Myghty request 
  object, just a dict. Updated session to use the new version.
* Removing unicode keys as some dbm backends can't handle unicode keys.
* Adding core files that should've been here.
* More stringent checking for existence of a session.
* Avoid recreating the session object when it's empty.
